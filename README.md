### Comments
This project is a survey that gives the user 25 rounds of choosing their favourite picture. Notable elements include that the user is not shown the same picture in two consecutive voting rounds, and that the data from which pictures are viewed and clicked is stored in local storage and the chart is updated from all past rounds on page refresh.
